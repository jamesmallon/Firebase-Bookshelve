It is necessary to have basic skills on Firebase and Calibre Software to understand it.

This package works this way:

You have an pdf file/book and you want to open it in the position you left it. Well, convert it to Htmlz with Calibre Software and, run mounting-books.sh script and use your Firebase account to keep the book on the position you left.
